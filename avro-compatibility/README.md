# Avro Schema Compatibility

This project demonstrates different strategies for Avro schema evolution.

The primary influence is the documentation on the subject by [Confluent](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/avro.html).

## Setup local environment

To setup a local environment to run the demos, follow the instructions in the [python](../python) subproject to install the Python `console-producer` and `console-consumer`.

## Demos

There are three different strategies for Avro schema evolution. Follow the links below to walk through a demo of each:

- [Backward Compatibility](backward.md)
- [Forward Compatibility](forward.md)
- [Full Compatibility](full.md)
